  <title>How to kickstart your rust learning journey on macos</title>
</svelte:head>

#### Install `rust`

```bash
brew install rustup
```

#### Install `rustc` and `cargo`

```bash
rustup-init

```

#### Check if everything is alright

```bash
rustc --version
cargo --version
```

#### Start a new rust project

```bash
cargo new <project_name_provide_your_own>
```

#### Run the project generated by cargo

```bash
cd <project_name_you_provided_in_the_previous_step>
cargo run
```

#### Run changes to your code automatically, i.e. on watch mode

This one needs a package called `cargo-watch`

```bash
cargo install cargo-watch
```

and

```bash
cargo watch -x run
```

or

```bash
cargo watch -x build
```

Happy rusting!
