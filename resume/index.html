<blockquote><p>I am good at JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS, reactjs and family. I have also worked in nodejs. I have been doing web development since 2011 and loved most of the journey. I am still super excited about the future of web development.</p></blockquote>
<p>I always keep performance in mind when building websites. It’s become harder and harder to keep a tab on site performance with an explosion of easy to use third party libraries. It’s never been easier to build awesome sites. But it’s also never been easier to build a slow one.</p>
<p>My technology of choice when building sites is html, css, javascript, typescript, reactjs, and nodejs.</p>
<p>I like the ideas behind functional programming and try to use them as much as possible in my own code. Immutability rules. I have dabbled a bit in purely functional programming languages like Elm and Haskell.</p>
<p>I like writing open source code code in my free time. Some of my personal work can be found on github - <a href="https://github.com/mukeshsoni" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/mukeshsoni</a>.</p>
