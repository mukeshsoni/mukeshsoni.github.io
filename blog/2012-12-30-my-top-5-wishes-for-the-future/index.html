<div class="post"><h2 style="margin-bottom: 0">My top 5 wishes for the future</h2>
<div class="date">2012-12-30</div>
	<p>Every now and then i am frustrated by one or the other event. Sometimes the govt. frustrates me, some times my own gadgets and at other times, any and everyone in my vicinity. Hereâ€™s my top 5 wish list for the future to reduce those frustrations -</p>
<ol><li>A smartphone with a battery which can run for 3-4 days without needed a recharge. That too with wifi/edge and gps on at all times.</li>
<li>A laptop with build quality like macbook pro but which does not get hot for a long period of time (say 2-3 hours). Infinitely cool laptops are most welcome.</li>
<li>Contraptions which attach to my smartphone and let me conduct basic medical tests. I am tired of being looted in the day by the doctor-tester mafia. 99% of my visits to doctors are useless. If at all, they result in me taking antibiotics which were not all required in the first place.</li>
<li>A system in place which lets me make complaints against my area MLA and promises an answer within a week. Make it a full fledged system with auditors and easy interfaces for the people to lodge a complain. Something like the courier tracking service.</li>
<li>Better medicine for depression patients. My mom has been suffering from depression for quite some time and none of the medicines seem to work. Googling about it i have come to realise that anti-depressants work on less than 50% of the affected people, which itself is a depressing fact. Seems it has to do something with the greed of the pharmaceutical companies.</li></ol>
<p>I hope that i can contribute to at least one of the above wishes. If anyone reading this post has any pointers to achieving any one of the above, do let me know. I would be more than happy to contribute time, money and sweat to bring it to fruition.</p>
<p>P.S. - A couple of days have passed and i realize that 5 wishes are not enough for me. Always hungry for more (read - frustrated by more). So here is an extended wish list -</p>
<ol><li>A good app/website to learn indian languages. I came to Bangalore one year back and have googled and googled about something decent to help me learn Kannada. Found a few resources but all of them are very basic. Someone up to the challenge?</li></ol>
